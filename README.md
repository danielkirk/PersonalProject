I made this application as a project to implore the registration already given by the ASP.NET framework. This application gives the user the ability to see movies currently out, see trailers for that movie, and get a recommendation based on their favorite genre. The aim was to make it so the user could have a personalized suggestions for movies currently in theatres.
